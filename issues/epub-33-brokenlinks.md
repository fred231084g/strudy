While crawling [EPUB 3.3](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/core/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#html-namespace
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/#sec-property-datatype
