Title: Broken references in Referrer Policy

---

While crawling [Referrer Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#navigate
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-document-window
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#concept-document-referrer-policy
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#an-iframe-srcdoc-document
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#referrer-policy-attribute
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#link-type-noreferrer
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-a-referrerpolicy
